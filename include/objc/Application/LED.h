/**

 * @headerfile LED.h Application/Application.h
 *
 * LED represents a class for changing Light Emitting Diode (LED) state.
 * You can create a LED instance to control the state (on/off) and brightness
 * of the LED, depending on the hardware capabilities.
 *
 * LEDs can either be the on-board status LED or external LEDs connected to GPIO
 * pins, and can either be configured as binary (on/off) or support varying
 * linear brightness levels, using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for finer
 * control.
