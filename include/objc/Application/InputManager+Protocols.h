/**
 * @brief Delegate callback for key/button events.
 *
 * @param sender The source of the event (input device or source object).
 * @param code The platform-independent logical key code (see KEYCODE_*).
 * @param scanCode Hardware scan code or platform-specific scancode; may be
 *                 0 if unavailable.
 * @param ch The character produced by the key event, or 0 if none.
 * @param state Bitmask of `NXInputState` flags representing the current
 *              key/button state and modifier state (clicks, repeat, shift,
 *              control, etc.).
 *
 * Called when a key, button, or touchscreen press is reported to the input
 * manager. The delegate receives both the logical key code and the hardware
 * scan code (if available), along with a character value when the event
 * produces a printable character.
 *
 * If the event represents a touchscreen press, the input manager will
 * emit `KEYCODE_BTNTOUCH` as the logical code and set the corresponding
 * state flags.
