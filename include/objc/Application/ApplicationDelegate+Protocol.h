 * This method is invoked when the application receives system signals such as
 * termination requests (SIGTERM), interrupt signals (SIGINT/Ctrl+C), or quit
 * signals (SIGQUIT). Implement this method to handle signals gracefully by
 * performing cleanup operations, saving state, or initiating shutdown
 * procedures.
 *
 * If this method is not implemented, the application will terminate
 * with a -1 exit status when it receives a NXApplicationSignalTerm or
 * NXApplicationSignalQuit signal. Other signals may be ignored.
 *
 * In the future, this method may be called for power management events,
 * such as low or empty battery conditions, or sleep conditions, allowing
 * applications to respond appropriately to changes in power status.
 *
 * @note This method may be called from a signal handler context on some
 * platforms. Keep the implementation simple and avoid blocking operations,
 * memory allocation, or complex system calls.
 *
 * @see NXApplicationSignal for available signal types.
