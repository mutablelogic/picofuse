 * The Application class serves as the central hub for application management.
 * An NXApplication instance is created automatically by invoking the
 * NXApplicationMain function, which initializes the application and starts the
 * main run loop.
 *
 * You don't create instances of this class directly; instead, you use the
 * sharedApplication method to access the singleton instance. The Application
 * class is responsible for handling command-line arguments, setting the
 * application delegate, starting the main run loop, handling events and then
 * terminating the application gracefully.
