/**
 * @brief The NXMap class
 * @ingroup Foundation
 * @headerfile NXMap.h Foundation/Foundation.h
 *
 * NXMap represents a map that can store key-value pairs, where keys are
 * strings and values are arbitrary objects.
 *
 * The map uses an optimized hash table implementation for efficient storage
 * and retrieval of key-value pairs. Keys must be string objects that implement
 * the NXConstantStringProtocol.
 *
 * Objects stored in the map are retained and will be released when the map
 * is deallocated, when an object is removed,  or when removeAllObjects is
 * called.

 * This method creates a new map by taking pairs of arguments where each odd
 * argument is an object and each even argument is its corresponding key. The
