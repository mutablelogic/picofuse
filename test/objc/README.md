# Test Suite Documentation

This directory contains test coverage for the runtime, NXFoundation and NXApplication frameworks. Tests can be run with `make tests` from the project root directory.

The tests are designed to work correctly in both debug and release builds (`RELEASE=1`), with proper handling of assertions and error conditions.

The tests are organized into four main categories:

## Test Categories

- **Runtime System Tests** (sys_00 through sys_17): Tests for low-level system functionality including memory management, I/O operations, threading, synchronization primitives, event queues, cross-core communication, hash table operations, environment information, and atomic operations.
- **Objective-C Runtime Tests** (runtime_01 through runtime_37): Tests for the Objective-C runtime system functionality.
- **NXFoundation Tests** (NXFoundation_01 through NXFoundation_24): Tests for the NXFoundation framework classes and functionality.
- **NXApplication Tests** (NXApplication_01 only): Tests for the NXApplication framework classes and functionality.
- **Runtime Hardware Interface Tests** (hw_00 through hw_03): Tests for low-level hardware interface functionality.
- **Pixel Tests** (pix_01): Tests for the pixel and display system functionality.
